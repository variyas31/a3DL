# 📈 Recurrent Neural Networks for Stock Price Prediction 🚀

## 📜 Abstract
In this exciting project, we delve into the world of finance and technology by exploring the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models, for the dynamic task of predicting stock prices. 🌐 This repository is a treasure trove containing a detailed research paper and a practical Jupyter Notebook. Together, they demonstrate the power and intricacies of applying deep learning techniques to financial forecasting. 💹

## 🛠 Installation
To embark on this journey of financial data analysis with RNNs, ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then, gear up your machine learning toolkit with these packages:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow keras keras_tuner scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn plotly yfinance statsmodels arch
```

## 📊 Usage
To dive into the analysis:
1. 🌟 Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. 📓 Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Assignment 3- Variyas.ipynb`) in your favorite Jupyter environment.
3. 🚀 Run the cells in sequence to witness the magic of data transformation, model building, training, and evaluation in action!

## 🔍 Methodology
Our adventure includes these pivotal steps:
- **Data Acquisition** 🌐: Fetching historical stock price data using the `yfinance` library.
- **Data Preprocessing** 🧹: Cleaning and normalizing the data for the RNN feast.
- **Model Building** 🏗: Crafting and tuning various RNN architectures, including the mighty LSTM and the agile GRU.
- **Training and Validation** 🏋️‍♀️: Training the models on historical data and validating their prowess.
- **Evaluation** 📈: Measuring the predictive accuracy with meticulous metrics and analyses.

## 📝 Research Paper
Accompanying this repository is a scholarly research paper (Assignment 3- DL- Variyas.pdf) that sails deep into the theoretical oceans of RNNs. 🌊 It encompasses a thorough literature review, an elaborate methodology, and a critical analysis of the results. This paper is a beacon guiding through the complexities and nuances of stock price prediction using deep learning. 📘
